# Realtime-Sign-Language-Translation-to-Speech-DNN
This project is carried out for the InnovateFPGA 2019 competition as regional finalists in the AciaPacific region. Our project
details are available in [here](http://www.innovatefpga.com/cgi-bin/innovate/teams.pl?Id=AP047).

This project consist of three main sections and they are;
* Training a DNN to classify atleast 5 sign langage gestures.
* Inferencing of the DNN and fusion of sensors using the DE10-Nano FPGA board
* Interfacing of external devices with the DE10-Nano FPGA board

This repository mainly focuses on the training of the DNN for sign language translation - for sign language gesture
classification.
This process was started by identifying a few features to train a Support Vector Classifier to do the classification
